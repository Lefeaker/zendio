## Introduction

- **One-line pitch**: Zendio is a browser extension for saving web pages, selected fragments, reading sessions, video notes, and AI chat conversations as structured Markdown for Obsidian.
- **What it solves**:
  - Reduces manual copy and paste across pages, videos, and conversations
  - Keeps source links, annotations, timestamps, screenshots, and YAML metadata together
  - Provides route rules, path templates, and YAML fields that fit Obsidian Bases, Dataview, and [Sidebar Highlights](https://github.com/trevware/obsidian-sidebar-highlights)
- **Who it is for**: researchers, engineers, writers, knowledge workers, and heavy Obsidian users.

## Current Capabilities

- Options and first-run setup are built on the current Stitch UI path with 12 release UI languages.
- Chromium builds can write through a user-selected local Vault folder; REST remains the fallback and the Firefox path.
- Video mode supports YouTube and Bilibili timestamp notes, captured text fragments, screenshot status dots, and screenshot attachments on export.
- Recent unsaved reader and video drafts can be restored for the latest 48 hours, up to the latest 5 pages and 20 recoverable items per page.
- Article, video, fragment, reading-session, and AI-chat notes each have dedicated path templates and YAML preview behavior.
- Support, feedback, contact, changelog, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy resources are available from Options and first-run setup.

## Feature Highlights

### Web Clipping

- Right-click to save any selection or full article.
- Extract title, URL, author, capture timestamp, and other metadata.
- Clean article body with Mozilla Readability while keeping checklists, code blocks, math, and tables.
- Generate Text Fragment URLs for one-click jumps back to the original paragraph.

### Fragment Comments

- Add annotations in the floating clipping panel while context is still visible.
- Save comments alongside the source text in structured Markdown.
- Timestamp-driven filenames prevent repeated clips from overwriting each other.
- Keyboard-friendly focus handling keeps the dialog usable without a mouse.

### Reading Sessions

- Merge fragments from one or more pages into a single reading note.
- Preserve reading order, source pages, and annotations.
- Restore recent unsaved reader drafts when the browser or tab is reopened within the retention window.

### Video Notes

- Capture timestamp notes from supported YouTube and Bilibili pages.
- Save comment, subtitle, or selected text fragments with jump-back links.
- Track whether each timestamp already has a screenshot; clicking the dot toggles the screenshot state.
- Export screenshot attachments with configurable location, filename, and Markdown URL templates.
- Use a dedicated video note path template, separate from article and fragment templates.

### AI Chat Conversation Capture

- Export conversations from ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, Tongyi Qianwen, DeepSeek, Kimi, and similar supported platforms.
- Remove platform chrome and reaction noise while preserving conversation structure and formatting.
- Optional metadata helpers use only the providers you configure; clipping and export do not require a model provider.

### Multi-Vault Routing

- Configure multiple Obsidian vault targets.
- Route content by domain, keyword, URL, priority, and fallback rules.
- Test connections from Options and repair missing configuration fields through diagnostics.

### YAML And Template Control

- Customize note paths for article, video, fragment, reading-session, and AI-chat exports.
- Configure YAML fields by content type, including domain-specific mapping rules.
- Preview YAML from the current editor state and selected content type.

### Localization

- Release UI languages: English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, German, French, Spanish (Spain), Spanish (Latin America), Italian, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Russian.
- Language names are displayed in their native form in the language selector.

## Install And Setup

1. **Build or download the extension**
   - For local testing, run `npm run build` and load `build/dist` in Chrome Developer Mode.
   - Firefox builds use the Firefox build/package scripts and the REST writing path.
2. **Choose a write path**
   - Recommended on Chromium: select a local Obsidian Vault folder in Options.
   - If local folder access is unavailable, denied, unsupported, or fails preflight, configure [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api).
   - Firefox uses [Obsidian Local REST API](https://github.com/coddingtonbear/obsidian-local-rest-api) for Vault writes.
3. **Finish Options setup**
   - Set vault targets and fallback behavior.
   - Configure route rules, path templates, YAML fields, video screenshot attachment templates, and optional providers.
   - Review privacy switches for anonymous usage statistics and error diagnostics.

## Development Baseline

- Node.js: `.nvmrc` pins `20.20.2`; package engines allow `>=20.19 <21`.
- npm: validated with `10.8.2`; package engines allow `>=10 <11`.
- `npm run test*` and `npm run visual*` entrypoints run `verify:runtime` first.
- Common local gates:
  - `npm run quality`
  - `npm run verify:preflight`
  - `npm run verify:stitch-secondary`
  - `npm run build`

Local folder access is optional and Chromium-only. Zendio cannot write to arbitrary local paths: you must explicitly choose a folder, writes are scoped to that browser-granted handle, and the handle can be cleared from Options.

## Quick Start

1. Select text, right-click, and choose the Zendio save action.
2. Add comments, tags, or a target vault in the floating panel.
3. For videos, use the Zendio video panel to add timestamp notes and screenshot states.
4. Finish a reading or video session to export the Markdown note and attachments.
5. Open Obsidian and review the saved note, YAML metadata, and linked assets.
